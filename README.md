# Software-Test-Automation-QA-CS-320
SNHU Course for Software Test Automation and QA Projects

Testing is the one of the fundamental ways to ensure that the code/program is functional and a key factor to show progress toward some kind of release or implementation. Being able to eliminate all the bugs and prevent any issues from occuring during the use of the code is also important when it comes to creating and growing a brand or branding yourself as a competent programmer. During this course, the focus was on a specific type of testing but the fundamentals were learned and the general knowledge of where to find resources for writing specific tests has been learned. The users needs are the basis for most programmers and most of the work will revolve around these needs. During testing, those requirements set by the client/user are the basis for testing as well to be the landmarks of functionality that have to be hit in order to have a "completed" product for the clients needs. The design for software also revolves around these requirements. After learning about the requirements, we can start to design efficient software or code as we see it and try to get it verified by the client as their vision as well.
